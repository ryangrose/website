# Sweden in Review

Well the time has come to leave *Sverige*. From the sun-filled summer to the cold crisp winter it's been a fantastic year full of new people, sights, and food. Oh, and dancing too of course. Saying goodbye was hard and I know I'll miss the night time kebabs with friends or the waterside coffee in the sun; but I also know I'm excited for what lies ahead. Last we left off we were in the middle of winter, so here's an account of the last months.

## Winter

The winter was long and dark but filled with warm nights with friends. There were only a few hours of light per day and the air was nippy so we spent most of our time indoors. We'd make foods and discuss differences in our home lands. On that note, biscuits and gravy is surprisingly difficult to explain. The biscuits aren't biscuits (Europeans picture the British idea of a biscuit ie a cookie). The gravy isn't really gravy and it has sausage that really isn't sausage. In the end I had to make them since they were too foreign. I jokingly say that I learned more about Germany and France than Sweden because of this :P

More snow came too of course. It would snow every couple of weeks and stick around even when it wasn't snowing. Sometimes the snow would all melt away, but soon it would be back, though never as deep or strong as in December. There were also way more Americans. It seemed like they all came for the second semester to avoid the majority of the winter months. To be honest, it was pretty weird to hear American voices in class again haha.

On a sadder note, my friend Daniel took his life during this time. It was quite a shock and we didn't really know what to do. After this the brew crew faded away and we made our last brew. I don't think we stopped directly because of this, but I'm sure it played some part. My only American friend also went home in this time after deciding that his studies weren't making him happy. He went back without any notice to pursue a career in music. While it was sad to have him leave, I'm glad he's doing what makes him happy.

I also injured my wrist in the winter. Basically it was an overuse injury from bad typing posture while coding for long periods of time. So keep good posture kids! Also, I ended up in a film shoot for some medieval festival! A friend asked if I'd come and gave me some clothes and I started. We filmed at this old castle in the snow by the lake. I had a lot more fun than I expected and met a lot of cool people.

## Spring

SUN!

Finally the sun came back! Before coming to Sweden I'd heard that Swedes loved the outdoors and tried to spend all the time they could outside since they can't during the winter, but I was a bit skeptical. I mean, most people like the outdoors so why wouldn't Swedes? But I was wrong. So very wrong. As soon as we had the first sunny day, I felt deep inside me the need to get outside. Despite the chilly weather, we went to buy barbecuing supplies but everything was sold out. There was nothing grill-related still in stock. Luckily we had some leftover burger patties, so we just bought bread and grilled by the beach. From here on out, any time I was in Stockholm, I was trying to get outside.

### Tallinn, Estonia

In March my friends Jon, Florian, Suguru and I took a cheap overnight boat ride to Tallinn. It's normally a booze cruise but we took it on a quiet winter weekday. Once we were far enough from land tons of old folks wheeled crates of vodka, rum, or schnapps to their rooms. This seemed to be the basis of the boat's business. A handful of times we went on deck, but the wind was cold and strong so we stuck to our cramped room.

On land snow covered everything. Concrete formed the Soviet-era buildings while glass featured in the newer ones. We briefly walked through this, but headed for the old town. There stone buildings were the norm. Tallinn's old town is exceptionally well preserved, maybe one of the best in Europe, and dates back to ???. The old castle walls mark the entrance to the town with two towers standing on either side. Stalls lined the streets on either side of the entrance, but colorful buildings dominated after that. We visited the main tourist attractions using Wikitravel as our guide. We were only there briefly but saw a lot and had a lot of fun.
